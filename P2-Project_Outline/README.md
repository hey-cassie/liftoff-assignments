## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever wondered how much you save on fuel while riding your bike? Likewise, have you ever wondered how many donuts you could buy with those savings? This sweet little app can answer both questions! Inspired by my love for both donuts and cycling and the desire to take some of the seriousness out of Strava while still tracking mileage, this app will provide post-ride analysis that includes total mileage, fuel savings and *roughly* how many donuts you can score with your hard-earned savings. Users will also have the option to search nearby donut shops and choose from different route options to find the donut route that is ideal for them and their bike. Sweet!
### Features
1. User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a brief profile page.
2. Fetch ride stats: Users will be able to fetch weekly and monthly cycling statistics (this data will be retrieved from the Strava API).
3. Generate fuel savings and donut count: This feature will allow users to check and track their weekly and monthly fuel savings and get a *rough estimate of how many donuts they can purchase with their savings.
4. Search: Users will be able to search nearby donut shops where they can spend their savings. Likewise, users will have the ability to search different route options to a selected donut spot.
