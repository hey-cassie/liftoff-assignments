## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever wondered how much you save on fuel while riding your bike/commuting to work? This handy app does the calculations for you and allows users to donate all or a portion of those savings to local nonprofits that advocate for cycling safety/safer streets. As a bike rider who has commuted to work for years, I know how fun and rewarding it can be. I also know that one bonus of bike commuting is the fuel savings. Likewise, I have worked in the nonprofit sector and know how hard it is to find funding that helps create and maintain safer streets. This app is meant to celebrate active transportation, and good health through bike commuting, while connecting riders with local bike advocacy organizations.
### Features
1. User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a short profile page.
2. Fetch ride stats: Users will be able to fetch weekly and monthly cycling statistics (this data will be retrieved from the Strava V3 API).
3. Generate fuel savings: This feature will allow users to check and track their weekly, monthly, and annual fuel savings.
4. Search: Users will be able to search local bike advocacy nonprofits where they can donate their savings.
